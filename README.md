# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis :

In this module, we focused on building a dynamic webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page and also we used CSS and Bootstrap to style the entire page.
We started by building a table to store and neatly display the data we want to work with. Then we added filters for multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape ) at the same time which let users refine their search on more than one level.

### UFO Sightings webpage : https://tjavaheripour.github.io/UFOs/

## Results
The webpage has a banner on top also shows article summary and brief article which grab attention. The user can re-initialize the page by clicking on UFO Sightings in the navbar.

### Deafult page

As you can see, there is a table with information about the UFO Sightings and Filter Search with 5 criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape) which make you able to filter the table. You can filter by one criteria or multiple and the table will return any results matching values.
Note that there is a placeholder's text in each box that provide the intended format of the inputs.
The image below shows what the table would looks once for example following filters have been applied :
- Date: 1/1/2010
- State: ca
- Shape: light
