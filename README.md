## Overview of the analysis :

In this module, we focused on building a dynamic webpage by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page and also we used CSS and Bootstrap to style the entire page.
We started by building a table to store and neatly display the data we want to work with. Then we added filters for multiple criteria (date, city, state, country, and shape ) at the same time which let users refine their search on more than one level.
